#  Rubicon - Team Manager Application
## Team Impromptu
### Proposal
The proposed solution addresses the use case in a few different ways:
* A main web tool (for use at the command center) will allow teams to be created easily, and for team status & updates to be viewed at a glance
* A mobile app (installed on each team memberâ€™s mobile phone) allows team leaders to see their team members & other teams in real-time, allows each team member to update their individual status, and enables requests by team leaders for additional personnel
* A connect Amazon Echo device will allow hands-free (audio) updates of team status from the field in the command center.
